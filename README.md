# AI Repo Co-Pilot

A tool-using AI agent that explores a code repository, retrieves relevant files, and produces citation-backed answers with strict JSON outputs.

## Goals
- No hallucinated file access
- Every claim backed by file path + line numbers
- Strict JSON schema outputs
- Reliability checks (tool usage, citations, schema validation)

## Status
Phase 1: Repo scaffolding complete.
